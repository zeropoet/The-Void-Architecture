# LoveLight

ðŸŒŸ *LoveLight* is an evolving art-tech project devoted to evoking the feeling of pure love â€”  
an all-embracing joy, a soft spiral of satisfaction, a radiant light from the heart.  

This repository gathers the visual, audio, and interactive components that together form  
a digital sanctuary â€” a hug made of code, sound, and symbol.

## âœ¨ Vision
To create an experience that:
- Feels like a warm embrace.
- Radiates light, connection, and gentleness.
- Invites presence and rewards softness.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `sigil/` â€” Sacred symbols and visual representations (golden mandalas, etc.)
- `soundscape/` â€” Audio prototypes of pure-tone ambient love light
- `interactive/` â€” Code sketches for interactive experiences (Python, Pygame)
- `docs/` â€” Conceptual notes, design ideas, and progress
