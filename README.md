# Void Architecture

This repository includes utilities for sampling frames and audio snippets from a library of video files and recombining them into a new video. The `sample_video.py` script uses [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) to handle video processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [`moviepy`](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/)
- `ffmpeg` installed on your system

Install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install moviepy
```

## Usage

```
python sample_video.py <library_directory> <output_directory> --samples 3 --duration 1.0
```

- `library_directory` is a folder containing `.mp4` files to sample from.
- `output_directory` will contain the extracted frame images, audio snippets, and the final video `final.mp4`.
- `--samples` defines how many random samples to pull from each video.
- `--duration` sets the length (in seconds) of each sampled clip.

## ERC-721 Support

A stub function `fetch_videos_from_erc721` is provided for future integration with Ethereum collections via IPFS. It is currently not implemented.
