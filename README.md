# LoveLight

🌟 *LoveLight* is an evolving art-tech project devoted to evoking the feeling of pure love —  
an all-embracing joy, a soft spiral of satisfaction, a radiant light from the heart.

This repository gathers the visual, audio, and interactive components that together form  
a digital sanctuary — a hug made of code, sound, and symbol.

## ✨ Vision
To create an experience that:
- Feels like a warm embrace.
- Radiates light, connection, and gentleness.
- Invites presence and rewards softness.

## 📂 Structure
- `sigil/` — Sacred symbols and visual representations (golden mandalas, etc.)
- `soundscape/` — Audio prototypes of pure-tone ambient love light
- `interactive/` — Code sketches for interactive experiences (Python, Pygame)
- `docs/` — Conceptual notes, design ideas, and progress

## 🌱 How to Begin
Clone the repo and explore:
```
git clone https://github.com/zeropoet/LoveLight.git
```
Run the interactive prototype:
```
cd LoveLight/interactive
python hug_prototype.py
```
