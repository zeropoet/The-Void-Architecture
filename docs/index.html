    <h4>voidarc.Ø</h4>
    <p>
      A field. A spatial principle. A way of organizing presence and intention. An experiential framework for recursive creation, seeded in reference, scaled in gesture, deepened by intention.

          What builds without wonder becomes prison.

          This is not owned.
          It is not fixed.
          It is only alive.
